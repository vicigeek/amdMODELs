**Answering Machine Detection AI models**

This repository contains trained deep learning models for Answering Machine Detection (AMD). These models help identify if a call is answered by a human or a machine (voicemail) and are optimized for fast CPU inference in telephony environments.

## ðŸ§ª Usage

### Inference with ONNX Runtime (Python)
```python
import onnxruntime as ort
import numpy as np

# Load ONNX model
session = ort.InferenceSession("voicemail_model.onnx")

# Load or prepare input features (shape: 1 x C x T)
features = np.load("input_features.npy").astype(np.float32)

# Run inference
outputs = session.run(None, {"input": features})
prediction = outputs[0]  # [voicemail_prob, human_prob]
